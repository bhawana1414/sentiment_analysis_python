It is fully open-sourced under the MIT License.\n\nIt gives us the value for **polarity**(positive/negative emotion) and **intensity** (strength of emotion). It uses human centric approach and combines qualitative analysis and emperical validation.\n#### Lexicon\nLexicon is a list of words(dictionary). For example positive lexicon is a list of all possible positive words (like good, amaze, appreciable etc.). Similarly negative lexicon is a list of all possible negative words (like bad, abolish, ambush etc.)\n* It was manually created and annotated by human raters.\n* The dictionary is “valence aware,” which means the terms have an associated weight indicating how positive or negative they are, rather than just a binary positive-negative classification. \nAdditionally, while VADER’s lexicon maps the sentiment of individual word tokens, most users are interested in analyzing full sentences or paragraphs of text rather than individual words. VADER would not be fully effective without also considering contextual information found in the sentence that can change the sentiment of a word. For this reason, VADER has five heuristics designed to detect contextual clues that affect the intensity or polarity of words in a sentence. \n\n#### Advantages of Vader :\n* It does not require any training data.\n* It can very well understand the sentiment of a text containing emoticons, slangs, conjunctions, capital words, punctuations and much more thus making it efficient to work with social media text.\n* VADER can work with multiple domains.\n* Good for evaluating public opinion, performing a competitive analysis, or enhancing customer experience.\n* Easier to understand\n\n#### Disadvantages of vader:\n* Misspellings and grammatical mistakes may cause the analysis to overlook important words or usage\n* Sarcasm and irony may be misinterpreted.\n* Analysis is language-specific.\n* Discriminating jargon, nomenclature, memes, or turns of phrase may not be recognized.\n* It only cares about individual words and completely ignores the context in which it is used.
